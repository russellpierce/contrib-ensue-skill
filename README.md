# Ensue Memory Network

Persistent memory layer for AI agents. Store, recall, search, and share memories with semantic vector search.

## Installation

```bash
# Step 1: Add the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/mutable-state-inc/ensue-skill

# Step 2: Install the plugin
/plugin install ensue-memory

# Step 3: Restart Claude Code for changes to take effect
```

## Setup

1. Get an API key from [ensue-network.ai/dashboard](https://www.ensue-network.ai/dashboard)

2. Add the MCP server to Claude Code:
```bash
claude mcp add memory-network-ensue https://api.ensue-network.ai/ --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Usage

Once installed, the skill triggers on natural language like:

| You say | What happens |
|---------|--------------|
| "Remember that the API key is stored in .env" | Creates a memory |
| "What was the database schema?" | Searches memories |
| "Search memories for authentication" | Semantic search |
| "Update the project notes" | Updates a memory |
| "List my memory keys" | Lists stored keys |
| "Share this with the team" | Shares a memory |

## How It Works

The skill uses curl to interact with the Ensue Memory Network API via JSON-RPC. Tools are discovered dynamically, so the skill stays current with server updates.
