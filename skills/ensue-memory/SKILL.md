# Ensue Memory Network

Dynamic memory service accessed via curl for fast CLI execution.

## Initialization (REQUIRED FIRST)

**Before doing anything else**, check for API key:

```bash
claude mcp get memory-network-ensue
```

If this returns a Bearer token in the headers, extract it and proceed.

If not configured, notify the user:
> "Ensue Memory Network is not configured. To set up:
> 1. Get an API key from https://www.ensue-network.ai/dashboard
> 2. Run: `claude mcp add memory-network-ensue https://api.ensue-network.ai/ --header \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\"`"

**Do not proceed until API key is available.**

## Tool Discovery

After confirming API key, discover available tools:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.ensue-network.ai/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/list","id":1}'
```

This returns current tool names, descriptions, and input schemas. **Always check schemas before calling** - they may change.

## Tool Invocation

Call tools via JSON-RPC:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.ensue-network.ai/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"<tool_name>","arguments":{<args>}},"id":1}'
```

## Intent Mapping

| "search for...", "find..." | search_memories |
| "update...", "change..." | update_memory |
| "delete...", "remove..." | delete_memory |
| "list keys", "show memories" | list_keys |
| "share with...", "give access..." | share |
